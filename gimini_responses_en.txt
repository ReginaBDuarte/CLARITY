## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is a 44-year-old male with no known cardiovascular disease or risk factors other than being mostly sedentary. His blood pressure and cholesterol levels are within normal ranges. Based on the SCORE2 risk assessment for moderate-risk countries, his 10-year risk of cardiovascular death is low. The factors contributing most to this classification are his age, non-smoking status, and acceptable blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Sedentary lifestyle is a factor warranting intervention, despite the low risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 40-year-old female is classified as having moderate cardiovascular risk according to the SCORE2 algorithm for moderate-risk countries. The primary contributing factors are her current smoking status and her age. Although her blood pressure and lipid profile are within acceptable ranges, smoking significantly elevates her risk. The presence of non-specific ventricular repolarization abnormalities on the ECG and increased arterial stiffness (PWV of 6.8 m/s) also act as risk modifiers, potentially increasing overall risk, even if they are not directly incorporated into the SCORE2 calculation.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is a 58-year-old asymptomatic female with a BMI approaching obesity. While her blood pressure is well-controlled, her calculated SCORE2 risk places her in the moderate-risk category. Although her cholesterol levels are not overtly elevated, her age contributes significantly to her overall risk. The absence of smoking and a coronary calcium score of zero are reassuring factors, but weight management is an area for improvement.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 41-year-old female patient is classified as high risk according to the SCORE2 risk estimation system. Her main risk factors are active smoking, uncontrolled hypertension, and elevated non-HDL cholesterol. The presence of pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.3%) further elevates her risk. Left ventricular remodeling and mild left atrial dilation on echocardiogram also contribute to the overall cardiovascular risk. The presyncope episode, while potentially vasovagal, warrants further investigation to rule out a cardiac etiology.

*Calculation Details:*

*   Total Cholesterol = 197 mg/dL
*   HDL Cholesterol = 57 mg/dL
*   Non-HDL Cholesterol = Total Cholesterol - HDL Cholesterol = 197 - 57 = 140 mg/dL
*   Age = 57 years
*   Systolic Blood Pressure = 120 mmHg
*   Smoking = Smoker
*   Using the ESC SCORE2 chart for moderate-risk countries, the estimated 10-year risk is approximately 2,3%.
*   Risk category: Based on SCORE2 ≥ 2,5% - <5%, and age, the patient is classified as moderate risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as moderate risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The primary contributing factors are her age (57 years), current smoking status, and non-HDL cholesterol of 140 mg/dL. Although her blood pressure is well-controlled, the presence of dyslipidemia and smoking elevate her risk profile. Addressing smoking cessation is paramount, and optimizing lipid management could further reduce her cardiovascular risk. While her exercise stress test was normal and she wishes to begin exercising, comprehensive risk factor management is crucial.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. This is primarily driven by his smoking history (50 pack-years) and elevated non-HDL cholesterol, despite his relatively young age. The presence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease and a coronary artery calcium score >0 further contribute to the risk reclassification to high. The daytime hypertension, even if the 24-hour average is normal, also contributes to the overall risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to established cardiovascular disease, specifically moderate aortic stenosis. Although blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol are reasonably controlled, the presence of aortic stenosis significantly elevates her risk. Additionally, the ECG findings suggestive of ischemia and elevated NT-proBNP further contribute to the risk assessment. Her age (67 years) also plays a role.

## 4. Treatment Recommendations

**Note:**
*   SCORE2 was calculated using the ESC online calculator for moderate-risk countries (Portugal), inputting the provided values (age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and non-HDL cholesterol). The calculator yields a SCORE2 of 5.3%.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 62-year-old male is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. Key contributors include his age, history of former smoking (50 pack-years), hypertension, and a SCORE2 value of 5.3%. Additionally, the presence of pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.2%, Fasting Glucose 105 mg/dL) and concentric left ventricular remodeling act as risk modifiers and contribute to an increased risk profile. Of note, bradycardia is present, likely due to nebivolol and/or atrioventricular block.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as high risk based on the 2021 ESC guidelines. The main contributing factors are the patient's uncontrolled hypertension (average 24-hour BP 147/87 mmHg), active smoking history, elevated non-HDL cholesterol (209 mg/dL), and a family history of premature coronary artery disease (mother with CABG at 68). Although her BMI is low, the other factors outweigh any potential protective effect. The presence of COPD is an additional risk modifier.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 41-year-old male has several cardiovascular risk factors. His elevated blood pressure (155/107 mmHg) is a major contributor. Smoking (5 cigarettes/day) and elevated non-HDL cholesterol (208 mg/dL) further increase his risk. Although his family history includes hypertension and diabetes in his mother, and colon cancer in his father, the SCORE2 calculation does not directly incorporate parental history of early-onset CVD in moderate-risk countries. The hypertensive response to exercise is also an important risk factor to consider. His SCORE2 estimates his 10-year risk at 5.5%, classifying him as high risk.

**Explanation:**

*   SCORE2 is applicable as the patient is from a moderate-risk country and doesn't fall into any of the exception categories (established CVD, very high single risk, familial hypercholesterolemia, diabetes with organ damage, CKD grade 3-5).
*   SCORE2 was estimated using the ESC chart based on the values extracted on the table above (Female, age 56, smoker, 163 mmHg, non-HDL cholesterol 179 mg/dL).
*   Since the patient is <70 years old and SCORE2 is between 7.5% and <10% the patient has High Risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as high risk for cardiovascular events based on the SCORE2 risk assessment. The major contributing factors include her age (56 years), current smoking status, elevated systolic blood pressure (163 mmHg), and high non-HDL cholesterol (179 mg/dL). Additionally, her history of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, prediabetes, and depressive syndrome further elevate her risk profile. The presence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), as suggested by the clinical presentation, echocardiogram and NT-proBNP levels, also increases her cardiovascular risk. Poor adherence to medication is another contributing factor.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high-risk according to the ESC 2021 guidelines. This classification is primarily driven by his age, smoking history, poorly controlled hypertension, and elevated non-HDL cholesterol. While the coronary CT angiography showed non-obstructive disease, the presence of a calcium score in the 50th-75th percentile also acts as a risk modifier, further increasing his cardiovascular risk. The family history of premature coronary artery disease and diabetes also contribute to this elevated risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 64-year-old woman undergoing preoperative evaluation is classified as high-risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. Her age and smoking history are major contributing factors. The systolic blood pressure of 143 mmHg is also elevated, although only slightly. The LDL cholesterol level is borderline high; however, the increased SCORE2 estimation confirms the need to consider pharmacological therapy. Elevated NT-proBNP in the absence of structural heart disease (except for concentric remodeling and left atrial enlargement, both frequent findings in hypertensive heart disease) may represent an additional risk factor.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The main contributing factors are his age (65 years), history of smoking, elevated systolic blood pressure (147 mmHg), and dyslipidemia with a non-HDL cholesterol of 96 mg/dL. Additional risk modifiers include pre-diabetes (fasting glucose 111mg/dL, HbA1c 6.3%), obesity (BMI 28), sleep apnea, and low HDL cholesterol. Despite improvements due to lifestyle changes, further intervention is needed to optimize his cardiovascular risk profile.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 44-year-old man presents with arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although he is physically active and a non-smoker, his elevated blood pressure (both clinic and ambulatory) and high LDL-C, non-HDL-C, ApoB and Lp(a) levels contribute significantly to his moderate cardiovascular risk. Family history of premature MI in his mother and the lipoprotein(a) level further increase his risk. While his SCORE2 is initially moderate, the presence of Lp(a) elevates the pre-test probability of cardiovascular disease and, therefore, the confidence in the moderate risk classification should be high.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 54-year-old woman is classified as moderate risk according to the SCORE2 algorithm for moderate-risk countries. Her smoking history, rheumatoid arthritis (a chronic inflammatory disease), and non-optimal LDL cholesterol levels contributed to this classification. While her blood pressure is currently controlled, and other traditional risk factors are within normal limits, the presence of documented non-obstructive coronary artery disease on CCTA with a CAC score > 0 further increases her risk. The atypical chest pain warrants further investigation, but the absence of ischemia on the exercise test is reassuring.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as high risk based on the SCORE2 calculation, driven primarily by his age, elevated systolic blood pressure, and non-HDL cholesterol levels. The presence of pre-diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea, and a coronary calcium score above the 75th percentile further elevate his risk. Although NT-proBNP is low, atrial fibrillation (even paroxysmal), left ventricular remodeling, and left atrial dilation suggest underlying cardiac dysfunction and increased risk. Lifestyle factors such as obesity and possible inadequate sleep also contribute.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to the presence of chronic kidney disease (eGFR 42 mL/min/1.73m²). Although she has a healthy lifestyle (exercises regularly, doesn't smoke or drink, good sleep hygiene) and her blood pressure is reasonably controlled, her underlying kidney disease significantly elevates her cardiovascular risk. The microalbuminuria also contributes to this risk. Despite being on a statin, her LDL cholesterol is above the target for very high-risk patients.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines due to her age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and calculated SCORE2. Although her blood pressure is reasonably controlled, and she engages in regular physical activity, the presence of diabetes significantly elevates her cardiovascular risk. Her LDL-C is above the target for high-risk individuals, and HbA1c indicates suboptimal glycemic control, further contributing to the risk classification. The echocardiogram showing concentric remodeling of the left ventricle, and the presence of degenerative osteoarticular disease of the knees and spine can also contribute to the high risk classification.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to having type 2 diabetes and several cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, overweight, and former smoking. The presence of diabetes automatically places him in at least the high-risk category, which is upgraded to very high risk considering his multiple risk factors. Although his blood pressure and HbA1c are reasonably controlled, his LDL cholesterol is above target. Shift work and poor sleep quality are additional risk modifiers.

**Method:** Online calculator for moderate-risk countries (Portugal), taking into account age, gender, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol.

**Risk Calculation Explanation:** Considering the patient's age, gender, non-smoking status, blood pressure, and non-HDL cholesterol, the SCORE2 risk was calculated using an online calculator designed for moderate-risk countries like Portugal.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. Her age (65 years), poorly controlled hypertension (138/75 mmHg), diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia are the major contributing factors. Additionally, chronic kidney disease (eGFR 57 mL/min/1.73 m2) and overweight (BMI 28.8) are risk modifiers that elevate her overall cardiovascular risk. Although LDL cholesterol is reasonably controlled (79 mg/dL), her HbA1c (6.9%) indicates suboptimal glycemic control. The presence of microalbuminuria further increases her risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to the presence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and an LDL-C level of 258 mg/dL, significantly above the threshold for high-risk individuals, further increased by family history of premature cardiovascular disease (mother with AMI at 47 years old and sudden death in a first-degree relative). The patient's elevated blood pressure (134/87 mmHg) and borderline high triglycerides (164 mg/dL) also contribute to the overall cardiovascular risk. While the exercise test was normal, the genetic diagnosis and family history strongly indicate the need for aggressive risk factor modification.

*   Gender: Female
*   Smoking: Smoker
*   Systolic Blood Pressure: 124 mmHg
*   Non-HDL Cholesterol: 145 mg/dL

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as moderate risk according to the SCORE2 algorithm. Her age, female gender, and smoking status are the main drivers for this classification. Although her blood pressure and cholesterol levels are within the normal range, smoking significantly increases her cardiovascular risk. The presence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease on CT angiography and a coronary artery calcium score of 86 also contribute to the risk profile, but do not lead to reclassification into a higher risk category.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to a prior myocardial infarction (established cardiovascular disease). Although his blood pressure and LDL cholesterol are currently well-controlled on medication, his history of a significant cardiovascular event overrides any risk calculation based solely on risk factors. His former smoking history and sedentary lifestyle also contribute to his overall risk profile. The presence of prior revascularization further reinforces this classification.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as very high risk due to established cardiovascular disease (previous coronary angioplasty). Although her blood pressure and lipid profile are well-controlled, the history of previous revascularization places her in the highest risk category according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. Former smoking also contributes to the overall risk profile. Her age is also a significant risk factor.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to having established cardiovascular disease (ischemic stroke). Additional risk factors include hypertension (although reasonably controlled), dyslipidemia, being overweight, and a history of smoking. Pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.4% and fasting glucose 112 mg/dL) and left atrial enlargement are also present, further increasing the risk. The presence of concentric left ventricular remodeling might suggest hypertensive heart disease.
