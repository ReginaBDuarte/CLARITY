## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

Based on the SCORE2 calculation for moderate-risk countries, this 44-year-old male falls into the low-risk category. His age, non-smoking status, relatively well-controlled blood pressure, and acceptable cholesterol levels contribute to this classification. The presence of isolated ventricular extrasystoles, while warranting further investigation, does not directly impact the SCORE2 calculation. A sedentary lifestyle is a risk modifier but does not significantly elevate his short-term cardiovascular risk based on SCORE2.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 40-year-old female patient is classified as low risk according to the SCORE2 calculator for moderate-risk countries. Her risk is primarily driven by her current smoking status. Her blood pressure and lipid profile are within acceptable ranges and do not significantly contribute to her overall risk. The presence of nonspecific ventricular repolarization changes on the ECG warrants consideration; however, the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring result is reassuring. Arterial stiffness, measured by pulse wave velocity, is borderline elevated.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a BMI of 29.9, placing her in the overweight category. Her blood pressure is within the normal range, and she is a non-smoker. Her lipid profile is generally acceptable, with an LDL cholesterol of 105 mg/dL and non-HDL cholesterol of 117 mg/dL. The coronary artery calcium score of 0 is reassuring. Using the SCORE2 calculator, her 10-year risk of cardiovascular death is estimated to be 1,0%, placing her in the low-risk category. The main contributing factors are age and gender, but her healthy lifestyle (non-smoker, regular exercise) positively impacts her risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 41-year-old female patient is classified as having moderate cardiovascular risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The primary contributing factors include active smoking, elevated systolic blood pressure, and high non-HDL cholesterol. Her history of hypertension, even though she discontinued medication, and the presence of concentric left ventricular remodeling further contribute to the overall risk. The HbA1c of 6.3% suggests pre-diabetes, adding another layer of concern. Although her BMI is only slightly elevated, addressing lifestyle factors and optimizing risk factor control are crucial.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 48-year-old male is classified as having moderate cardiovascular risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The main contributing factors are his uncontrolled hypertension (despite ambulatory monitoring confirming elevated blood pressure), elevated non-HDL cholesterol, pre-diabetes, elevated uric acid and increased arterial stiffness. Additionally, his BMI is over the normal range. Although he denies smoking, the presence of several risk factors elevates his overall cardiovascular risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 57-year-old female patient is classified as having moderate cardiovascular risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The main contributing factors are her age, smoking status, and non-HDL cholesterol. Although her blood pressure is well-controlled, smoking significantly elevates her risk profile. While individual LDL-C is not very elevated, her non-HDL cholesterol is borderline optimal. Addressing smoking and optimizing lipid levels are key for risk reduction.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as moderate risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The major contributing factors are his age (52 years), smoking history (50 pack-years), and elevated daytime blood pressure (138/86 mmHg). Additionally, his elevated non-HDL cholesterol (187 mg/dL) and coronary artery calcium score of 23 further contribute to his risk. While the ABPM was normal overall, the elevated daytime readings are concerning.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 67-year-old female presents with fatigue and has several cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a family history of CVD (not explicitly stated but implied due to aspirin use). Although her blood pressure is reasonably controlled, the presence of moderate aortic stenosis, left ventricular remodeling, and an elevated NT-proBNP suggest underlying cardiac disease and contribute significantly to her moderate risk stratification. The patient is already on statin therapy, with an LDL cholesterol within target ranges.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 62-year-old male is classified as moderate risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The primary contributing factors are his age, former smoking history (50 pack-years), hypertension and his non-HDL cholesterol. The presence of pre-diabetes, concentric remodeling of the left ventricle, and daytime 2:1 AV block might act as risk modifiers. Further investigation into the cause of syncope is warranted.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as high-risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines due to her uncontrolled hypertension and smoking history. Although her age is relatively young (47 years), the markedly elevated systolic blood pressure (189 mmHg) significantly increases her risk. The additional risk factors, such as high non-HDL cholesterol (209 mg/dL) and family history of premature coronary artery disease, further contribute to the overall risk profile. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is also present, which may increase cardiovascular risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 41-year-old male has a moderate cardiovascular risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The most significant contributing factors are his smoking habit, elevated systolic blood pressure (155 mmHg), and elevated non-HDL cholesterol (208 mg/dL). The family history of hypertension and diabetes in his mother also contributes. Although his HbA1c is slightly elevated, it does not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high risk based on the SCORE2 calculation. The main contributing factors include her age, smoking history (40 pack-years), elevated systolic blood pressure (163 mmHg), and elevated non-HDL cholesterol (179 mg/dL). The presence of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.3%, fasting glucose 113 mg/dL) further increase her cardiovascular risk. Additionally, the elevated NT-proBNP and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) diagnosis found in the additional diagnostic testing also contribute.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high risk primarily due to his smoking history, poorly controlled hypertension despite medication, and elevated non-HDL cholesterol. His family history of premature coronary artery disease and parental diabetes further contribute to his risk profile. The coronary artery calcium score also indicates the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Although he is currently being treated with a statin, his LDL-C remains above target and his blood pressure needs better control.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The major contributing factors are her age (64 years), smoking history, and elevated systolic blood pressure. The SCORE2 calculation, based on these factors and her non-HDL cholesterol level, estimates a 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease of 5,2%. The presence of concentric remodeling of the left ventricle, moderate left atrial dilation, and a calcified aortic valve without functional compromise further support this risk classification, even though they are not directly included in the SCORE2 calculation.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 65-year-old male is classified as moderate risk according to the SCORE2 model. His age and history of former smoking are contributing factors. While his total and LDL cholesterol are well-controlled, his HDL is low and triglycerides elevated, resulting in a slightly elevated non-HDL cholesterol. The blood pressure of 147/68 mmHg, despite the ABPM showing controlled BP on medication, warrants attention given the symptomatic hypotension and discontinuation of previous treatment.  Prediabetes and sleep apnea may increase his cardiovascular risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 44-year-old male is classified as moderate risk according to the SCORE2 risk stratification, primarily driven by his elevated non-HDL cholesterol (192 mg/dL) and a slightly elevated blood pressure (average 130/86 mmHg on ABPM). Family history of premature MI in his mother is also a relevant factor. Lipoprotein(a) of 92 mg/dL and ApoB of 172 mg/dL are elevated risk modifiers. Although he maintains a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and no smoking, these other risk factors necessitate intervention.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is a 54-year-old female smoker with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and anxiety. Her blood pressure is slightly elevated (132/84 mmHg) and her LDL cholesterol is 133 mg/dL. Her hs-CRP is also elevated at 4.5 mg/L. The coronary CT angiography revealed a calcium score of 77, indicating the presence of coronary artery disease. The SCORE2 calculation indicates moderate risk, primarily driven by age, smoking, and elevated blood pressure, combined with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. The presence of rheumatoid arthritis and elevated hs-CRP serve as risk modifiers, potentially underestimating the true cardiovascular risk.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. His age, elevated systolic blood pressure, and elevated non-HDL cholesterol contributed to this classification. The presence of pre-diabetes, obesity, and sleep apnea act as risk modifiers, further increasing his overall cardiovascular risk. The coronary calcium score (178) also contributes to risk stratification. Atrial fibrillation, although recently diagnosed, warrants appropriate management, including stroke risk assessment.

Although her blood pressure is reasonably controlled and she has a healthy BMI, the presence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) leading to CKD significantly elevates her cardiovascular risk, independent of SCORE2 calculation. Her triglyceride levels are slightly elevated. The beneficial impact of regular exercise helps to mitigate overall risk.

## 4. Treatment Recommendations

The patient has chronic kidney disease, which is an exception for SCORE2 calculation. Therefore, he is automatically classified as high risk.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease is classified as high risk due to his CKD. While his blood pressure and LDL cholesterol are currently well-controlled with medication, his pre-existing conditions significantly elevate his overall cardiovascular risk. The moderate aortic regurgitation also warrants consideration in his overall management.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 59-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and overweight, presents a high cardiovascular risk according to the SCORE2 calculator for moderate-risk countries. The SCORE2 is elevated due to her age, female gender, systolic blood pressure, and non-HDL cholesterol levels, which, in combination with her diabetes diagnosis, significantly increase her risk. Although she is a non-smoker and engages in regular physical activity, her HbA1c is above target, and LDL is at 100 mg/dl indicating suboptimal glycemic and lipid control.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 59-year-old male with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a history of smoking is classified as high risk according to the 2021 ESC guidelines. The major contributing factors are his age, history of smoking, diabetes, less than optimally controlled blood pressure, and elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Although his LDL cholesterol is currently above target despite statin therapy, his HbA1c and blood pressure are reasonably controlled. Sleep issues related to shift work represent an important risk modifier.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 65-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia is at high cardiovascular risk according to the ESC SCORE2 calculator. Her age, hypertension, and non-HDL cholesterol levels contribute significantly to her risk. While her LDL cholesterol is relatively controlled, her blood pressure remains slightly elevated despite multiple medications. The presence of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sedentary lifestyle further increases her risk profile. The patient's low functional capacity, as indicated by the exercise stress test, also suggests a need for more aggressive risk management.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Although he is young, the genetic predisposition to high LDL cholesterol levels, coupled with a positive family history, significantly elevates his cardiovascular risk. The elevated blood pressure and sedentary lifestyle further contribute to the overall risk profile. Early and aggressive intervention is warranted to mitigate long-term cardiovascular consequences.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as moderate risk according to the SCORE2 algorithm. The main contributing factors are her age (61 years) and current smoking status. Although her blood pressure and cholesterol levels are within the normal range, the fact that she is a current smoker significantly increases her risk. The coronary calcium score of 186 indicates the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis, which is considered a risk modifier and further justifies a more proactive approach to risk reduction.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 63-year-old woman is classified as high risk due to her prior history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (coronary angioplasty). Her age is also a contributing factor. Although her blood pressure and cholesterol levels are reasonably well-controlled, the presence of established CVD elevates her risk significantly. The fact that she quit smoking two years ago is a positive factor, but it does not negate the impact of her prior CVD event. Anxiety and the use of sertraline/alprazolam are potential risk modifiers.

## 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as very high risk due to established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ischemic stroke). Additional risk factors include hypertension, dyslipidemia, overweight, former smoking history, and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6.4%, fasting glucose 112 mg/dL). The presence of left atrial enlargement on echocardiogram suggests possible diastolic dysfunction and increases the risk of future atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic events. Although LDL-C is at target, triglycerides are elevated. The scattered bilateral rhonchi on pulmonary auscultation warrant further investigation and optimized treatment of COPD.
