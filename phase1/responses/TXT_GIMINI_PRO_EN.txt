3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events of 1%, classifying him as Low-to-Moderate risk. This favorable classification is primarily due to his young age, being a non-smoker, having optimal blood pressure (114/72 mmHg), and a well-controlled lipid profile (non-HDL cholesterol 128 mg/dL). Although he leads a sedentary lifestyle, the absence of major traditional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, or diabetes results in a very low estimated risk according to the SCORE2 model. The presenting complaint of palpitations was investigated and attributed to benign extrasystoles, not impacting his cardiovascular risk assessment.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
The patient is classified as having a low-to-moderate 10-year risk of cardiovascular events. This classification is primarily driven by her young age (40 years), well-controlled blood pressure (confirmed by 24h-ABPM), and a favorable lipid profile, particularly a high HDL-cholesterol level.

Her main modifiable risk factor is smoking, which significantly increases her risk compared to a non-smoker with the same profile. However, given her other protective factors, her calculated SCORE2 remains below the threshold for a higher risk category for her age group. The planned smoking cessation is a critical step to maintain and further reduce her future cardiovascular risk.

| No | Chronic Kidney Disease (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1,73m²) | Not Applicable | High | Very High |

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as being at high cardiovascular risk. This classification is not based on the SCORE2 algorithm but on the presence of a high-risk condition, specifically moderate Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Her creatinine of 1,2 mg/dL, age, and gender result in an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of approximately 49 mL/min/1,73m², which falls into the CKD Stage 3a category. According to the 2021 ESC guidelines, this automatically places her in the high-risk group.

While most of her conventional risk factors are well-controlled (non-smoker, normal blood pressure, acceptable lipid profile), the presence of CKD is the dominant determinant of her risk. The coronary artery calcium score of zero is a favorable risk modifier that suggests a lower burden of atherosclerosis, but it does not override the high-risk classification conferred by CKD.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 54-year-old male presents a favorable cardiovascular risk profile for his age. His 10-year risk of a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event (SCORE2) is 3%, placing him in the Low-to-Moderate risk category. This is primarily due to being a non-smoker with optimal blood pressure (118/60 mmHg), a normal BMI (23 kg/m²), and a well-controlled lipid profile (LDL 110 mg/dL, non-HDL 128 mg/dL). Although the calculated short-term risk is low, his sedentary lifestyle and notable family history of cardiovascular disease, particularly the paternal grandfather's early sudden death, are important risk modifiers. These factors warrant a comprehensive discussion about lifestyle interventions, such as increasing physical activity, to mitigate his long-term cardiovascular risk.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as having a **Low-to-Moderate risk** for a 10-year fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular event, with a calculated **SCORE2 of 3,5%**.

This classification is primarily determined by her age (63 years) and moderately elevated cholesterol levels (Total Cholesterol 214 mg/dL, LDL 122 mg/dL). However, several protective factors prevent her risk from being higher: she is a non-smoker, has excellent blood pressure control (107/58 mmHg), a high HDL-cholesterol level (67 mg/dL), and no diabetes.

While she has a history of atrial fibrillation, this condition is currently controlled and anticoagulated, and for the purpose of primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk prediction using SCORE2, she is considered apparently healthy. Therefore, her risk is not high enough to place her in a higher risk category based on current guidelines.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as having a **High** 10-year cardiovascular risk. Although she is young (41 years), her SCORE2 of 4% exceeds the high-risk threshold of ≥2,5% for her age group. This classification is primarily driven by the combination of major, uncontrolled modifiable risk factors: active smoking with a significant history (25 pack-years), uncontrolled stage 1 hypertension (146/85 mmHg), and severe dyslipidemia with markedly elevated total cholesterol (270 mg/dL) and LDL-cholesterol (189 mg/dL).

Furthermore, the presence of risk modifiers reinforces this classification. These include pre-diabetes (HbA1c of 6,3%) and, critically, imaging evidence of hypertension-mediated target organ damage (concentric left ventricular remodeling and mild left atrial dilation on echocardiogram), which independently increase her cardiovascular risk beyond the calculated score.

The patient is classified as being at **High Risk** for a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years, with a calculated SCORE2 of 6,6%. This classification is primarily driven by the presence of uncontrolled Grade 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 161 mmHg) and significant dyslipidemia (non-HDL cholesterol of 188 mg/dL), which are key components of the SCORE2 algorithm.

His risk is further amplified by several risk modifiers, including pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,2%), borderline renal function (eGFR ≈ 60 mL/min/1.73m²), increased arterial stiffness, hyperuricemia, and symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea. Although not part of the score, these factors contribute to his overall and lifetime cardiovascular risk, reinforcing the need for intensive lifestyle interventions and pharmacological treatment.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as having a **High** 10-year risk of cardiovascular events (5%). This classification is primarily driven by her **age (57 years)** and her status as an **active smoker**. Although her blood pressure is well-controlled and her BMI is within the normal range, her lipid profile (non-HDL cholesterol of 140 mg/dL and LDL of 119 mg/dL) contributes to the overall risk. The combination of these factors, especially persistent smoking, elevates her risk profile significantly despite the absence of other overt conditions like diabetes or severe hypertension. Addressing smoking cessation is the most critical intervention to reduce her future cardiovascular risk.

| No | Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease | Not Applicable | Very High | Very High |

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 52-year-old male is classified as being at **Very High** cardiovascular risk. Although his SCORE2 risk score is not applicable for formal calculation, the presence of non-obstructive coronary plaques on cardiac CT angiography constitutes documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). According to the 2021 ESC guidelines, any individual with documented ASCVD is automatically placed in the very high-risk category, overriding risk score calculations.

His risk is further compounded by multiple contributing factors, including a very significant smoking history (50 pack-years), dyslipidemia (elevated total and LDL cholesterol, low HDL), and masked hypertension, evidenced by elevated daytime ambulatory blood pressure despite a normal office reading. The presence of pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5,9%) also acts as a risk modifier.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as being at **Very High Risk** for cardiovascular events. This classification is not based on the SCORE2 calculation, which is intended for apparently healthy individuals. Instead, it is based on the definitive diagnosis of established cardiovascular disease, specifically moderate calcific aortic stenosis, confirmed by echocardiography.

According to the 2021 ESC guidelines, any patient with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), either clinical or unequivocal on imaging, is automatically placed in the highest risk category. The presence of symptomatic, moderate valvular heart disease overrides risk score estimation. The patient's symptoms of fatigue on exertion are consistent with the hemodynamic significance of the stenosis. The elevated NT-proBNP and concentric left ventricular remodeling further support a high-risk profile due to chronic pressure overload.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events is 7,0%, placing him in the low-to-moderate risk category for his age. This calculation is primarily based on his age (62 years), male gender, and history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, although currently treated. His significant past smoking history (50 pack-years) is a crucial lifelong risk factor, even though he is now considered a non-smoker for calculation purposes. The presence of risk modifiers, specifically pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,2%) and a history of cancer, suggests his true risk may be higher than the calculated score. These factors warrant consideration for more intensive preventive strategies, despite the SCORE2 result.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 47-year-old female is classified as being at **High Risk** for cardiovascular events. The primary determinant for this classification is the presence of grade 3 hypertension (office blood pressure of 189/103 mmHg), which, according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines, automatically places an individual in the high-risk category, irrespective of the SCORE2 calculation. Her risk profile is further aggravated by a substantial smoking history (52 pack-years), severe dyslipidemia with markedly elevated total and LDL cholesterol (184 mg/dL), and the presence of risk modifiers such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5,8%). These factors collectively underscore the need for intensive risk factor management.

| Yes | Not applicable | 4,6 | High | High |

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as high-risk despite his age (41 years). This is due to the synergistic effect of multiple uncontrolled, major cardiovascular risk factors. His 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (SCORE2) is 4,6%, which falls into the high-risk category for individuals under 50 years old (threshold ≥2,5%).

The main drivers for this classification are grade 2 hypertension (155/107 mmHg), severe dyslipidemia with very high LDL-cholesterol (188 mg/dL) and non-HDL cholesterol (208 mg/dL), and active smoking. The presence of pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5,8%) further modulates and increases his overall risk profile. These factors require intensive management to reduce his future cardiovascular event burden.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified in the High Risk category. This classification is not based on the SCORE2 calculation but on the presence of a superseding high-risk condition: moderate Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30-59 ml/min/1.73m², as per the 2021 ESC Guidelines. This risk is further amplified by numerous uncontrolled factors, including severe hypertension (163/91 mmHg) despite medication, active smoking with a significant history, and dyslipidemia (non-HDL 179 mg/dL). Additional risk modifiers such as obesity (BMI 31,3) and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,3%) contribute to her profile. The diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction represents significant target organ damage, underscoring the severity of her condition.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This is a 51-year-old male smoker with uncontrolled hypertension and dyslipidemia despite statin therapy. His calculated 10-year cardiovascular risk using SCORE2 is 7%, which falls into the low-to-moderate risk category for his age. However, the presence of significant subclinical atherosclerosis, evidenced by non-obstructive plaques in three coronary arteries and a calcium score of 47 on coronary CT angiography, automatically up-classifies his risk. According to the 2021 ESC Guidelines, individuals with documented atherosclerotic plaque are considered to be at high cardiovascular risk, irrespective of their calculated SCORE2. Additional contributing factors include his elevated non-HDL cholesterol (165 mg/dL), LDL-cholesterol (148 mg/dL), pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5,8%), and elevated lipoprotein(a).

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as having a high 10-year risk of cardiovascular events, with a calculated SCORE2 of 8%. This classification is primarily driven by her age (64 years), active smoking status with a significant 40 pack-year history, and elevated systolic blood pressure (143 mmHg, Stage 1 Hypertension).

This risk level is further reinforced by the presence of several risk modifiers. These include pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5,9%), a current diagnosis of cancer, and evidence of subclinical cardiac damage, such as left ventricular concentric remodeling, left atrial dilation, and an elevated NT-proBNP level. These factors collectively indicate a higher cardiovascular risk than suggested by the SCORE2 value alone and underscore the need for intensive risk factor management.

| Yes | N/A | 11 | High | High |

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as **High Risk** for cardiovascular events in the next 10 years. This classification is primarily driven by his age (65 years) and uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (147 mmHg) off medication. Although his LDL-cholesterol is low, the atherogenic dyslipidemia profile, characterized by low HDL-cholesterol (33 mg/dL) and high triglycerides (237 mg/dL), contributes to the risk. Furthermore, several risk modifiers are present, including pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,3%), obstructive sleep apnea, and a sedentary lifestyle. Crucially, the echocardiogram reveals evidence of target organ damage (concentric left ventricular remodeling and left atrial enlargement), which significantly elevates his baseline risk profile, confirming the high-risk classification despite some controlled risk factors.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This is a 44-year-old male whose 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events is 2,0%, classifying him as low-to-moderate risk according to the SCORE2 model. The main contributing factors are Grade 1 hypertension, confirmed by 24-hour ABPM, and significant dyslipidemia with elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C.

However, the SCORE2 calculation likely underestimates his true lifetime risk. He has several important risk modifiers that should be considered to re-stratify his risk upwards: a family history of premature cardiovascular disease (mother with MI at 61), a very high Lipoprotein(a) level (92 mg/dL), and a significantly elevated ApoB (172 mg/dL). These factors indicate a strong underlying atherogenic potential, warranting a more intensive preventive strategy than what might be suggested by the SCORE2 value alone.

**3. Brief Clinical Explanation**

This patient is classified as being at **Very High Risk** for cardiovascular events. This classification is not based on a risk score but on the definitive presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, unequivocally demonstrated by coronary CT angiography, which revealed multiple coronary plaques. This finding automatically places the patient in the highest risk category, regardless of her other risk factors. Her risk is further amplified by significant modifiers, including an active smoking history, a chronic inflammatory condition (rheumatoid arthritis), and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which contribute to the atherosclerotic process.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 61-year-old male is classified as being at **Very High** cardiovascular risk. His 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events is 10% according to the SCORE2 algorithm. This calculation is driven primarily by his age, uncontrolled stage 1 hypertension (151/94 mmHg), and elevated non-HDL cholesterol (169 mg/dL).

The confidence in this classification is very high, as it is strongly reinforced by the presence of multiple significant risk modifiers and target organ damage. These include central obesity, pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,3%), severe obstructive sleep apnea, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis, confirmed by a coronary artery calcium score of 178. These factors collectively place him in a higher risk category than his traditional risk factors alone might suggest, mandating intensive risk factor management.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
This patient's cardiovascular risk is classified as high, not based on a calculated score, but due to the presence of moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 42 mL/min/1.73 m2. According to the 2021 ESC guidelines, individuals with an eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 are automatically considered at high risk for cardiovascular events, irrespective of other risk factors. Although her blood pressure and cholesterol levels are controlled with medication, the underlying CKD is the primary driver of her elevated long-term cardiovascular risk.

Although his blood pressure (131/78 mmHg) and LDL cholesterol (65 mg/dL) are well-controlled with medication, other contributing factors include his age (61 years), male gender, and histories of hypertension and dyslipidemia. The presence of severe CKD is a major risk-enhancing condition that supersedes the standard SCORE2 risk calculation, which is not applicable in this case.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 59-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes has her cardiovascular risk stratified according to specific ESC 2021 criteria for patients with diabetes, making the SCORE2 algorithm not applicable. She is classified as being at High Risk. This classification is primarily due to the presence of diabetes mellitus in a patient over 50 years of age, co-existing with other major cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia (under treatment) and suboptimal glycemic control (HbA1c of 7,8%). Although her blood pressure is currently controlled without medication, the combination of these factors places her in the high-risk category. The presence of concentric left ventricular remodeling on the echocardiogram further reinforces this risk level. She does not meet the criteria for very high risk as she has no established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or severe target organ damage.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This 59-year-old patient is classified as being at **Very High** cardiovascular risk. Although his blood pressure and glycemic control are close to targets, the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus coexisting with multiple other major risk factors—hypertension, dyslipidemia, a significant 20 pack-year smoking history, and overweight (BMI 29,8 kg/m²)—automatically places him in this category according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines.

In such cases, risk is considered high enough that a risk score calculation like SCORE2 is not necessary for initial stratification. The synergistic effect of these co-morbidities significantly increases his 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, warranting the most intensive preventive strategies.

This is a 65-year-old woman with a 12-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The SCORE2 model is not applicable for her risk calculation. According to the 2021 ESC Guidelines, patients with diabetes are automatically classified as high or very high risk. She falls into the **Very High Risk** category due to the documented presence of Target Organ Damage. This is evidenced by chronic kidney disease (eGFR 57 mL/min/1.73m²) with significant albuminuria (103 mg/g), and cardiac structural changes including left ventricular concentric remodeling and mild left atrial dilation seen on the echocardiogram. Other contributing factors include her age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as being at very high cardiovascular risk. This classification is not based on the SCORE2 calculation, which is not applicable in this case. The primary determinant is the confirmed genetic diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), a condition that intrinsically confers a high to very high risk. The classification is elevated to "very high" due to the presence of markedly elevated LDL cholesterol (258 mg/dL) combined with a significant risk modifier: a strong family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (mother with myocardial infarction at 47 years and maternal aunt with sudden cardiac death at 51 years).

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as being at **Very High Risk** for cardiovascular events. This classification is not based on a risk score but on the definitive finding of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) documented by coronary CT angiography. The imaging revealed an occlusion of the mid right coronary artery and multiple other plaques. According to the 2021 ESC guidelines, any individual with documented ASC, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging, is automatically placed in the very high-risk category, overriding the need for SCORE2 calculation. Her smoking history and the significantly elevated coronary artery calcium score (186) further reinforce this high-risk profile, indicating a substantial plaque burden.

### 3. Brief Clinical Explanation

The patient is classified as being at **Very High Risk** for future cardiovascular events. This classification is not based on a risk score but on the presence of established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), specifically a history of myocardial infarction at age 49. According to the 2021 ESC Guidelines, any individual with documented ASCV is automatically placed in the highest risk category for secondary prevention purposes. While his current risk factors, such as blood pressure (118/67 mmHg) and LDL-cholesterol (70 mg/dL), are well-controlled with medication, this does not change his underlying risk status. Other contributing factors to his initial event include a significant smoking history (40 pack-years) and a sedentary lifestyle.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient is classified as being at **Very High** cardiovascular risk due to a documented history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, specifically a recent ischemic stroke. The ESC 2021 guidelines automatically place individuals with established ASCVD in the highest risk category, without the need for SCORE2 calculation.

This classification is further supported by the presence of multiple uncontrolled or poorly controlled risk factors and modifiers. These include diagnosed hypertension (despite triple therapy), dyslipidemia, a significant 40 pack-year smoking history, overweight status (BMI 28,7), a sedentary lifestyle, and laboratory evidence of pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,4%). The echocardiographic findings of concentric left ventricular remodeling and severe left atrial enlargement also contribute to this elevated risk profile, indicating target organ damage secondary to chronic hypertension.
