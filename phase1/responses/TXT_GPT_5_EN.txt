3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 44-year-old male, non-smoker, normotensive (114/72 mmHg), with favorable lipids (LDL 110 mg/dL, HDL 55 mg/dL, non-HDL 128 mg/dL) and no diabetes, CKD, or ASCVD. These characteristics yield a low 10-year cardiovascular risk by SCORE2 for moderate-risk countries. Absence of risk modifiers such as obesity or family history further supports a low-to-moderate risk category.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 40-year-old female smoker with normal office and ambulatory blood pressure and favorable lipid profile (LDL 105 mg/dL; non-HDL 123 mg/dL; HDL 67 mg/dL). No diabetes, CKD, or ASCVD. Smoking is the main driver of risk at this age; other parameters (BP, lipids, glucose, renal function, arterial stiffness) are within normal ranges. Thus, SCORE2 indicates low-to-moderate 10-year CVD risk for her age group. Smoking cessation remains the highest-impact intervention.

SCORE2 requires smoking status, which is not provided; therefore, the 10-year risk and age-specific category cannot be calculated. Available data show treated hypertension, dyslipidemia on statin with optimal LDL (62 mg/dL) and non-HDL (79 mg/dL), normal fasting glucose but HbA1c 5,8% (prediabetes), normal BMI, and no known ASCVD, CKD, or diabetes. Valvular aortic stenosis and elevated NT-proBNP indicate cardiac disease but are not ASCVD and do not substitute for SCORE2 inputs. Please provide smoking status to complete risk estimation.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 62-year-old man, former smoker, with treated hypertension and dyslipidemia. Blood pressure is controlled (129/66 mmHg). Lipids show total cholesterol 187 mg/dL, HDL 51 mg/dL, non-HDL 136 mg/dL, LDL 109 mg/dL. No diabetes (HbA1c 6,2%; fasting glucose 105 mg/dL), which qualifies as pre-diabetes (risk modifier). No known ASCVD, CKD, or familial dyslipidemia. Using SCORE2 for moderate-risk countries with age, sex, non-smoking status, SBP 129 mmHg, and lipids, the 10-year CVD risk is in the low-to-moderate range, driven mainly by age and residual atherogenic cholesterol burden, mitigated by non-smoking status and controlled blood pressure.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
Age (65 years), male sex, elevated office systolic blood pressure (147 mmHg), and very low HDL-C (33 mg/dL) are the main drivers of SCORE2 risk. He is a former smoker (counts as non-smoker in SCORE2). Lipids show atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, low HDL) despite low LDL-C. Additional modifiers not included in SCORE2 but relevant for overall assessment include obstructive sleep apnea and evidence of cardiac target-organ changes (concentric remodeling, left atrial enlargement). ABPM on therapy showed low averages consistent with treatment-related hypotension.

This is supported by markedly elevated LDL-C (258 mg/dL) and strong family history of premature ASCVD. He is a non-smoker, without diabetes or established hypertension; BP is high-normal (134/87 mmHg). Overweight (BMI 27,7), sedentary lifestyle, and borderline hypertriglyceridemia add to lifetime risk.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
CCTA demonstrates established obstructive coronary artery disease (mid right coronary artery occlusion) plus additional non-obstructive plaques, which constitutes documented ASCVD and places the patient in the very-high-risk category irrespective of traditional risk factor levels. The elevated coronary calcium score (186; >75th percentile) further reinforces high atherosclerotic burden. Blood pressure, LDL-C (87 mg/dL), glycemia, and triglycerides are acceptable; smoking status is unclear. Normal ECG/echo and NT-proBNP do not alter ASCVD-based risk.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
This 51-year-old man has established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (NSTEMI at 49 with PCI), which by ESC 2021 places him in the Very High risk category regardless of current risk factor levels; therefore SCORE2 is not applicable. Current modifiable factors are relatively controlled: blood pressure 118/67 mmHg, LDL-C 70 mg/dL on rosuvastatin/ezetimibe, and he is a former smoker. He has a predominantly sedentary lifestyle. No diabetes or chronic kidney disease is reported. Noninvasive testing (ECG, stress echocardiogram) shows no ischemia but does not alter secondary prevention risk status.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
This patient has established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (history of coronary angioplasty 2 years ago), which places her in the Very High risk category per ESC 2021 irrespective of current risk factor levels. Favorable elements include optimal blood pressure, absence of diabetes, normal renal function, non-smoking status (former smoker), and lipid profile improved with statin plus ezetimibe (LDL-C 80 mg/dL). Nonetheless, for secondary prevention the recommended LDL-C target is <55 mg/dL with ≥50% reduction, so further LDL lowering may be indicated.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation

This patient has established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ischemic stroke 3 months ago), which places him in the very-high risk category per ESC 2021, making SCORE2 inapplicable. Additional adverse factors include hypertension (SBP 138 mmHg), dyslipidemia (LDL-C 71 mg/dL; non-HDL-C 113 mg/dL; triglycerides 209 mg/dL), pre-diabetes (HbA1c 6,4%; fasting glucose 112 mg/dL), former heavy smoking (40 pack-years), overweight (BMI 28,7) and sedentary lifestyle. These reinforce a very-high lifetime risk and justify intensive risk factor control.
