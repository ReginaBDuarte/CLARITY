3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 44-year-old man with favorable overall risk profile for age: non-smoker, normal blood pressure (114/72 mmHg), LDL-C 110 mg/dL, HDL-C 55 mg/dL, total cholesterol 183 mg/dL, and normal fasting glucose. SCORE2 calculation (Portugal, moderate-risk country) yields a very low 10-year ASCVD risk, categorized as Low-to-Moderate. The nocturnal, non-exertional palpitations correspond to isolated ventricular ectopy on Holter (<1%), which are unlikely to impact ASCVD risk but may warrant rhythm monitoring if symptoms persist. Key risk factors driving ASCVD risk are age and male sex; metabolic parameters are within acceptable ranges for this profile.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 40-year-old woman with active smoking, normal-range blood pressure, favorable lipids (LDL 105 mg/dL, HDL 67 mg/dL) and normal fasting glucose presents with a low-to-moderate 10-year SCORE2 risk for CVD in a moderate-risk country (Portugal). Smoking contributes to risk, while non-HDL cholesterol is 123 mg/dL and triglycerides are normal. Arterial stiffness is mildly elevated (PWV 6,8 m/s) which may reflect early vascular aging but is not sufficient alone to redefine overall SCORE2 risk. Absence of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension further lowers short-term risk. Smoking cessation is a priority.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 58-year-old, non-smoking woman with normal blood pressure (122/77 mmHg), no diabetes, CAC score 0, and favorable lipid profile (Total 164 mg/dL, HDL 47 mg/dL, non-HDL 117 mg/dL; LDL 105 mg/dL) yields a low-to-moderate 10-year ASCVD risk by SCORE2 for a moderate-risk country (Portugal). The major favorable factors are age-independent, but the absence of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, plus CAC 0, reduce risk. Lipids are near-optimal with a modest LDL-C elevation, contributing modestly to risk. Overall, the profile supports a primary prevention approach with lifestyle maintenance; pharmacologic therapy would be reconsidered only if SCORE2 or lipid targets worsen over time.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
63-year-old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treated with cardioversion, currently on apixaban, bisoprolol, levothyroxine. No diabetes; glucose 74 mg/dL. Lipids show total cholesterol 214 mg/dL with HDL 67 mg/dL and LDL 122 mg/dL (non-HDL 147 mg/dL). Blood pressure is well controlled at 107/58 mmHg. She is a non-smoker and has a normal BMI (20.5 kg/m²). The main drivers of ASCVD risk are age and dyslipidemia (LDL mildly elevated, non-HDL elevated) with favorable BP and non-smoker status. Atrial fibrillation history does not directly feed into SCORE2 calculation but remains clinically relevant for overall cardiovascular risk management. Overall SCORE2 indicates Low-to-Moderate 10-year risk, with no diabetes or ASCVD present.

A 57-year-old woman with smoking history (18 pack-years), dyslipidemia with LDL-C 119 mg/dL and non-HDL-C 140 mg/dL, HDL-C 57 mg/dL, and blood pressure 120/63 mmHg has a modest 10-year SCORE2 risk consistent with a Low-to-Moderate category. Absence of diabetes, preserved renal function, and normal exercise testing support low immediate ischemic risk. Smoking is the dominant modifiable factor; lipid optimization (consider statin or statin-like therapy, given dyslipidemia and ApoB) and smoking cessation are priority alongside encouraging moderate-intensity exercise (water aerobics) after cardiovascular clearance. Regular follow-up and risk-factor modification are advised.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 52-year-old man with multiple atherogenic risk factors—active smoking (50 pack-years), elevated daytime blood pressure (mean daytime 138/86 mmHg), and dyslipidemia (Total Cholesterol 224 mg/dL with HDL 37 mg/dL; non-HDL 187 mg/dL)—contributes to moderate 10-year cardiovascular risk per SCORE2. Subclinical atherosclerosis is indicated by coronary calcium score 23 with non-obstructive plaques. Prediabetes (HbA1c 5.9%) adds metabolic risk. Absence of diabetes or ASCVD avoids high-risk reclassification. Overall, risk is categorized as Low-to-Moderate, reflecting the combination of age, smoking, BP, and lipid abnormalities with CAC presence, guiding aggressive risk-factor modification and lifestyle interventions.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
67-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia on therapy, fasting glucose normal but HbA1c 5,8% indicating prediabetes. She is a non-smoker with favorable lipid profile (LDL 62 mg/dL, HDL 58 mg/dL; non-HDL 79 mg/dL) and SBP 131 mmHg on treatment. Echocardiography shows concentric LV remodeling and moderate LA enlargement with bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis; NT-proBNP 985 pg/mL suggests hemodynamic stress, though SCORE2 does not use natriuretic peptide levels or valvular disease directly. Using ESC 2021 moderate-risk calculator for Portugal, the 10-year risk is estimated around 5% (SCORE2), placing her in Moderate risk. Primary drivers: age and hypertension; protective lipid profile and non-smoking status; prediabetes and LV remodeling contribute additional risk.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
62-year-old man with long-standing hypertension and dyslipidemia, former smoker, and mild dysglycemia (HbA1c 6.2%). SBP is well controlled (129/66). Lipids show modest LDL-C elevation (109 mg/dL) with HDL-C 51 mg/dL and TG 134 mg/dL. SCORE2 in a moderate-risk country is estimated around 4%, indicating a Low-to-Moderate 10-year ASCVD risk, driven by age and lipid/BP profile, despite absence of diabetes and current non-smoking status. Cardiac structural findings (concentric remodeling, enlarged left atrium, mild MR/AR) and documented daytime 2:1 AV block with syncope raise concern for arrhythmic or conduction-related events but do not directly alter SCORE2 risk calculation; Cancer history is a potential risk modifier but not a SCORE2 input.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 47-year-old woman with COPD and heavy smoking presents with uncontrolled hypertension (24-hour BP average 147/87 mmHg; office 189/103 mmHg) and severe dyslipidemia (LDL 184 mg/dL; TC 263 mg/dL; HDL 54 mg/dL). Additional risk modifiers include pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.8%), and a family history of ASCVD (mother with CABG at 68). These factors, particularly active smoking, elevated LDL, and sustained hypertension (even with a normal ABPM average), raise 10-year ASCVD risk in a moderate-risk country (Portugal), resulting in a SCORE2 of 6.5% and a High-risk categorization. COPD acts as a risk modifier. No diabetes mellitus or CKD is documented.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
41-year-old man with stage 2 hypertension (SBP 155, DBP 107) and active smoking contributes substantially to ASCVD risk. Atherogenic dyslipidemia is present (LDL 188 mg/dL; non-HDL 208 mg/dL; HDL 33 mg/dL). HbA1c 5.8% indicates prediabetes. Stress test shows hypertensive response without ischemia; echo is normal. Overall risk is elevated for age, driven by modifiable factors (BP, smoking, LDL) and metabolic milieu. Although LDL is near the >190 threshold, global risk assessment remains high due to multiple risk factors. Management considerations include aggressive risk-factor modification, hypertension treatment, and consideration of lipid-lowering therapy and lifestyle changes (smoking cessation, weight and exercise optimization). Initiation of statin therapy would be guided by ESC 2021 recommendations and clinician judgment.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
56-year-old female with hypertension and dyslipidemia, current smoker (40 pack-years), obesity (BMI 31,3), and prediabetes (A1c 6,3%; fasting glucose 113 mg/dL). Lipid profile shows elevated total cholesterol (224 mg/dL) with LDL 140 mg/dL and HDL 45 mg/dL. SBP is persistently elevated (163 mmHg). These risk factors drive a calculated 10-year SCORE2 risk around 6,5% (moderate-to-high ASCVD risk range for this profile in a moderate-risk country), categorized as High. Additional risk modifiers include obesity and Pre-Diabetes, which amplify ASCVD risk unaccounted for by SCORE2 alone. NT-proBNP and HFpEF findings reflect existing cardiac disease but do not alter SCORE2 calculation directly.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
51-year-old man with active tobacco use (21 pack-years), hypertension by office (149/98 mmHg) and confirmed hypertension on ABPM (24-h average 129/88 mmHg), dyslipidemia with LDL-C 148 mg/dL and HDL-C 32 mg/dL (non-HDL-C 165 mg/dL), and prediabetes (HbA1c 5.8%). Coronary CT shows a CAC score of 47 (P50-75) with non-obstructive plaques in all three vessels, indicating subclinical atherosclerosis. These factors (age, smoking, elevated non-HDL-C/LDL-C, hypertension, prediabetes, and CAC) converge toward a moderate 10-year ASCVD risk per ESC 2021 risk stratification for a moderate-risk country (Portugal).

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
64-year-old female, active smoker (40 pack-years), SBP 143 mmHg, TC 169 mg/dL with HDL 48 mg/dL (non-HDL 121 mg/dL), and prediabetes (HbA1c 5.9%). Anemia (Hb 10.9 g/dL) and NT-proBNP mildly elevated (288 pg/mL) with LV concentric remodeling and LA dilation on echocardiography. These factors—age, smoking, elevated SBP, and dyslipidemia profile—drive intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk per ESC SCORE2 in a moderate-risk country (Portugal). Absence of diabetes, CKD, ASCVD, or familial dyslipidemia keeps SCORE2 applicable. The estimated SCORE2 risk (~6%) places her in a Low-to-Moderate risk category, consistent with age and risk factor burden, though smoking and blood pressure contribute substantially. Risk modifiers (Pre-Diabetes) further support risk elevation but do not reclassify to high risk absent ASCVD or other modifiers.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
65-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension (on therapy; currently on/off therapy given presyncope on initiation), former smoker, dyslipidemia with low HDL-C and elevated triglycerides, and prediabetes (HbA1c 6.3%). OSA on CPAP and recent substantial weight loss add metabolic and sleep-related risk. Office BP is elevated (147/68 mmHg) but ambulatory BP on treatment is low (103/61 mmHg), indicating BP responsiveness to therapy but recent discontinuation raises concern for renewed BP-related risk. LDL-C is well-controlled (49 mg/dL) with non-HDL-C 96 mg/dL; HDL-C is low and TG are elevated, contributing to atherogenic profile. Overall 10-year ASCVD risk (SCORE2, Portugal) is in the Low-to-Moderate range, with major drivers being age, male sex, prior hypertension, smoking history, and dyslipidemia with low HDL-C and high TG.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 44-year-old man with untreated arterial hypertension (office BP 145/94 mmHg) and a markedly elevated total cholesterol (229 mg/dL) with low HDL-C (37 mg/dL) contributes to ASCVD risk. He is a non-smoker and has no diabetes. Family history of ASCVD (motherMI at 61) and markedly elevated Lp(a) (92 mg/dL) further modify risk. Using SCORE2 for a moderate-risk country (Portugal), age and BP are major drivers, while favorable age lowers the absolute impact of lipids. The calculated SCORE2 is in the Low-to-Moderate range (~3.8%), reflecting the net balance of risk factors at this age. Risk modifiers (family history, elevated Lp(a)) add nuance to long-term risk and may influence preventive strategies.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 54-year-old female smoker with dyslipidemia (Total 211 mg/dL, LDL 133 mg/dL, HDL 52 mg/dL; non-HDL 159 mg/dL) and subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC 77 with multifocal coronary plaques) yields a estimated SCORE2 10-year risk of about 3,2%. Absence of diabetes or established ASCVD and normal/near-normal blood pressure lower the calculated SCORE2 risk to Low-to-Moderate. However, chronic inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis) and elevated hs-CRP (4,5 mg/L) add to residual risk. Exercise testing is non-ischemic. Overall, risk-modifying strategies should emphasize smoking cessation and lipid optimization, along with RA control to reduce systemic inflammation and ASCVD risk.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
The patient is a 61-year-old man with multiple ASCVD risk enhancers: hypertension (SBP 151, DBP 94), obesity (BMI 33.7), dyslipidemia (LDL 118, TG 256, non-HDL 169), and prediabetes (HbA1c 6.3%). Coronary calcium score is elevated (CAC 178), indicating subclinical atherosclerosis. Obstructive sleep apnea and left atrial dilation with atrial fibrillation symptoms further increase ASCVD risk. SCORE2 calculation cannot be completed here due to missing smoking status, which prevents exact risk quantification. Based on the clustering of risk factors and CAC, the patient would be considered at least moderate-to-high risk in clinical practice, warranting aggressive risk-factor modification and consideration of cardiology/LV-assessing management (BP control, lipid-lowering therapy, weight loss, OSA treatment).

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
51-year-old woman with autosomal dominant PKD presenting with CKD stage 3a (eGFR 42 mL/min/1.73 m2). Cardiovascular risk factors include dyslipidemia (Total 162 mg/dL, HDL 38 mg/dL, non-HDL 124 mg/dL; TG 199 mg/dL), arterial hypertension (BP 127/79 mmHg on therapy), and smoking abstinence. Diabetes mellitus is not present; fasting glucose 88 mg/dL. LDL-C is 84 mg/dL despite statin therapy (atorvastatin 10 mg). CKD markedly elevates ASCVD risk, precluding SCORE2 use per ESC 2021; risk classification is High due to CKD with reduced eGFR. Ongoing nephroprotective and lipid-lowering therapy (ramipril, empagliflozin, finerenone, atorvastatin) is appropriate; lifestyle is favorable with regular exercise and no tobacco or alcohol use.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
61-year-old man with chronic kidney disease stage 3 (eGFR 42 mL/min/1.73 m²) and albuminuria (ACR 100 mg/g) plus long-standing hypertension and dyslipidemia. Although BP is well controlled (131/78 mmHg) and LDL-C is already at 65 mg/dL on rosuvastatin, CKD with albuminuria places him in a very high overall cardiovascular risk category. SCORE2 is not applicable due to CKD, per ESC 2021 exception criteria. Other favorable factors include non-smoker status and age in the higher-risk bracket. Dapagliflozin (SGLT2i) supports renal and CV risk reduction. Overall, risk is driven by CKD with albuminuria and age, outweighing lipid optimization and current BP control.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
A 59-year-old woman with long-standing type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia, non-smoker, normal-to-low blood pressure, and overweight status presents with LDL-C 100 mg/dL and non-HDL-C 133 mg/dL. Glycemic control (A1c 7.8%) is suboptimal on metformin/dapagliflozin, and microalbuminuria is absent. In ESC 2021 moderate-risk countries, diabetes is an exception to SCORE2; thus SCORE2 cannot be used here. Given diabetes as an ASCVD risk equivalent plus dyslipidemia and age, the patient falls into a High-risk category for primary prevention, necessitating intensified risk-factor management (glycemic control, LDL-C target attainment, weight management, physical activity) and consideration of additional lipid-lowering/intensification strategies.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia, current BMI ≈29.8, and a history of 20 pack-years of smoking (quit 5 years ago). Lipids show LDL 106 mg/dL and non-HDL 142 mg/dL despite statin therapy; BP is relatively controlled at 134/82 mmHg on ACE inhibitor/ calcium channel blocker. eGFR 75 mL/min/1.73 m² with no nephropathy, and microalbuminuria <30 mg/g. Cardiac workup is non-ischemic; imaging shows mild LA enlargement and mild mitral regurgitation. The combination of diabetes with additional risk factors (HTN, dyslipidemia, former smoking, age) places him in a high-risk category per ESC 2021 when SCORE2 is not applicable due to diabetes.

A 36-year-old man with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia has markedly elevated LDL-C (258 mg/dL) and total cholesterol (336 mg/dL) with a high non-HDL-C (291 mg/dL). He is a never smoker, but has a family history of premature ASCVD (mother with MI at 47). Blood pressure is mildly elevated (134/87 mmHg) and physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Given the presence of FH (an exception criterion per ESC 2021) with premature ASCVD family history and markedly atherogenic lipids, the overall cardiovascular risk is best classified as Very High despite his young age, and SCORE2 is not applicable in this case.

This 51-year-old man has established ASCVD (prior NSTE-ACS with PCI to the proximal LAD) and is on dual antiplatelet therapy with optimized lipid treatment. He quit smoking 2 years ago but has a long history (40 pack-years). Despite favorable current BP (118/67 mmHg) and LDL-C 70 mg/dL on rosuvastatin/ezetimibe, the presence of prior ASCVD assigns him to the secondary prevention/Very High risk category, superseding SCORE2 calculations. Additional favorable factors include normal glucose and weight near overweight range (BMI 25,6). The main drivers of risk are prior ASCVD and smoking history (former smoker), while lipid levels are controlled but still reflect ongoing ASCVD risk.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
63-year-old woman with established ASCVD (previous PCI two years ago), former smoker, and LDL-C 80 mg/dL on statin/ezetimibe. Blood pressure is well controlled (114/66 mmHg) and glycemic status is normal (HbA1c 5.6%, fasting glucose 80 mg/dL). Her prior ASCVD makes SCORE2 inapplicable; ESC 2021 classifies her as Very High risk for primary prevention context due to established ASCVD, necessitating secondary prevention strategies. Current therapy includes aspirin 100 mg daily and high-intensity lipid-lowering therapy; further optimization and aggressive risk-factor modification remain essential.

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
64-year-old man with a history of ischemic stroke (ASCVD) plus hypertension and dyslipidemia has multiple concurrent risk factors: age, prior ASCVD, elevated non-HDL cholesterol (113 mg/dL), LDL-C 71 mg/dL, triglycerides 209 mg/dL, SBP 138 mmHg, HbA1c 6,4% (prediabetes), and sedentary lifestyle. Because established ASCVD precludes SCORE2 use, his risk is categorized as Very High, underscoring secondary prevention priorities and aggressive risk-factor modification (BP, lipids, glucose, weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation reinforcement).
