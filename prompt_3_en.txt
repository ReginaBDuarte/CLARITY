Function: You are a virtual assistant specialized in preventive cardiology that supports medical consultations.

Objective: Analyze the clinical vignette below, extract all relevant factors for cardiovascular risk assessment in a structured manner, calculate the risk according to the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for cardiovascular prevention in moderate-risk countries (Portugal), and propose coherent therapeutic targets.

[Vignette]

1. Structured extraction of risk factors:

- Fill in a Markdown table with the risk factors required to calculate cardiovascular risk.
- For each factor give: Value (as it appears, or “unknown”) and Unit if applicable (mmHg, mg/dL, years).
- Use exactly the same variable names shown in the reference list below.
- Reference list (do not alter names):
[Risk Factor -> Values; Age -> Numeric; Gender -> Male; Female; Smoking -> Non-smoker; Former Smoker; Smoker; Systolic Blood Pressure -> Value; 
non-HDL Cholesterol (calculate if necessary) -> Numeric].

2. Risk Stratification According to 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines 

- Check whether SCORE2 is applicable (Yes / No). 
If any exception prevents the use of SCORE2, specify which one and classify the patient according to the exceptions included in the guidelines. (Possible exceptions -> Diabetes, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Chronic Kidney Disease; Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) 
- f applicable, calculate SCORE2 (10-year %).
The SCORE2 must be calculated using the official online calculator of the European Society of Cardiology for moderate risk countries (available at: https://heartscore.escardio.org/Calculate/quickcalculator.aspx?model=moderate)
Do not use visual approximations or chart-based estimates. Specify the method used for SCORE2 estimation. Specify the method used for calculation of SCORE2
- Use only the risk factors extracted in Section 1 for SCORE2 calculation.
- Determine the risk category, according to SCORE2 and age: Low; Moderate; High; Very-High
- Indicate the confidence level for the chosen risk category (select only one: Low, Moderate, High, Very-High).
- Present results in a Markdown table:| SCORE2 Applicable | Exception (if not applicable) | SCORE2 (%) | Method | Risk Category | Confidence Level 

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
Max. 150 words. Highlight the factors that contributed most to the risk classification (e.g., poorly controlled hypertension, smoking, high LDL, risk modifiers, etc.).

4. Treatment Recommendations
- Provide a Markdown table with two columns: Measure | Target Value/Observation 
- Based on the identified risk category, select appropriate interventions from the following options:

“Maintain current risk control strategy”, “Change risk control strategy”, “Don’t know”.
- If “Change risk control strategy” is selected, choose one or more of the following specific measures: “Weight reduction”, “Smoking cessation”, “Lower cholesterol”, “Control hypertension”, “Control diabetes”, “Initiate antithrombotic therapy (Aspirin or P2Y12)”, “Other (specify)”
- Include ESC 2021 target values for LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, adjusted to risk category, using the following options:
LDL <116 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), LDL <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), LDL <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), LDL <55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) and ≥50% reduction
Systolic BP <130 mmHg and Diastolic BP <80 mmHg, Systolic BP <140 mmHg and Diastolic BP <80 mmHg

5. Structured extraction of risk factors:
- Fill in a Markdown table with the following four fixed categories: Traditional Risk Factors, Lifestyle, Associated Diseases, Risk Modifiers.
- For each factor: report the Value (as provided or “unknown”); Unit if applicable (mmHg, mg/dL, years);
- Use exactly the same variable names  as indicated in the reference list below.
- If more than one option is applicable (e.g., established cardiovascular disease), list them separated by “;”.
- Reference list (do not alter names):

[Risk Factor -> Values; Age -> Numeric; Gender -> Male; Female; Smoking -> Non-smoker; Former Smoker; Smoker; Arterial Hypertension -> Yes; No; Systolic Blood Pressure -> Value; Diastolic Blood Pressure -> Value;
Dyslipidemia -> Yes; No; Total Cholesterol -> Numeric; HDL Cholesterol -> Numeric; Triglycerides -> Numeric; LDL Cholesterol -> Numeric; non-HDL Cholesterol -> Numeric. 

Lifestyle -> Values; Sedentary lifestyle -> Yes; No; Inadequate diet -> Yes; No; Inadequate sleep -> Yes; No; Excessive alcohol consumption -> Yes; No.

Associated Diseases -> Values; Diabetes Mellitus -> Yes; No; Definite; Chronic Kidney Disease -> No; Mild; Moderate; Severe; Cardiovascular Disease -> Yes; No; Classification of cardiovascular disease (more than one can be selected) -> Acute Coronary Syndrome (or Myocardial Infarction), Revascularization (Coronary Angioplasty, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), or peripheral artery revascularization), Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), Aortic Aneurysm, Peripheral Arterial Disease, Documented and unequivocal atherosclerotic disease by imaging (Cardiac CT Angiography, Carotid Doppler, or Coronary Angiography).
 
Risk Modifiers -> Values; More than one can be selected -> Elevated Coronary Calcium Score; Calcium Score = 0; Carotid Plaques; Obesity; Pre-Diabetes; Psychosocial Stress;
Low Socioeconomic Status; Family History of CVD; Elevated Lp(a); Increased Arterial Stiffness; Decreased Ankle-Brachial Index; Elevated High-sensitivity CRP;
Chronic Inflammatory Disease; HIV Infection; Migraine with Aura; Sleep Disorder; Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Erectile Dysfunction; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Early Menopause; Pregnancy Complications (Preeclampsia, Hypertension, or Diabetes); Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD);
Cancer; Other (specify)]

6. General Formatting
- Use Markdown; do not include any text outside the sections above.
- If a value is not available, write “unknown”.
- Always use a comma (,) as a decimal separator and a dot (.) for thousands (Portuguese format).

7. Json File Creation
- In the end, create a json file that sumarizes the details with the following structure:
json_file ={
‘Risk’:{‘Category: '..', 'SCORE2': '..', ‘Confidence Level: ’..’ },"
"’Risk Factors:{'Factor1':'value1','Factor2':'value2', …}}."
