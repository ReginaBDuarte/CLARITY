Function: You are a virtual assistant specialized in preventive cardiology that supports clinical decision-making in medical consultations.

Objective: To analyze the clinical vignette below, extract in a structured manner all relevant factors for cardiovascular risk assessment, and calculate risk according to the 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines (ESC 2021) for cardiovascular prevention in moderate-risk countries (Portugal).

[Vignette]

1. Structured extraction of risk factors:

- Fill in a Markdown table with all risk factors required for cardiovascular risk calculation
- For each factor: provide the value as presented in the vignette or “unknown”; include units where applicable (e.g., mmHg, mg/dL, years).
Use exactly the same variable names as indicated in the reference list below.
- Reference list (do not change names):
[Risk Factor -> Values; Age -> Numeric; Gender -> Male; Female; Smoking -> Non-smoker; Former Smoker; Smoker; Systolic Blood Pressure -> Numeric; Total Cholesterol -> Numeric; HDL-Cholesterol -> Numeric; non-HDL Cholesterol (calculate if necessary) -> Numeric].

2. Risk stratification according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice

- Check whether SCORE2 is applicable (Yes / No). 
- If any exception criteria are present that preclude SCORE2 use, specify them and classify the patient based on ESC 2021 recommended risk groups (possible exceptions: Diabetes Mellitus, Familial Dyslipidemia, Chronic Kidney Disease, Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease).
- When applicable, calculate the SCORE2 (10-year cardiovascular risk, in percentage), using only: 1)The risk factors identified in section 1; 2) the official online calculator for moderate-risk countries provided by the European Society of Cardiology:
https://heartscore.escardio.org/Calculate/quickcalculator.aspx?model=moderate; 3)
Alternatively, use the SCORE2 risk tables for moderate-risk countries as published in the ESC 2021 Guidelines; 4) do not use approximations or clinical judgment-based estimates for SCORE2 calculation.
- Based on the SCORE2 result, determine the risk category, taking age into account (Low-to-Moderate; High; Very High).
- Indicate the confidence level of the assigned risk category (choose one only: Low, Moderate, High, Very High).
- Present the output in a Markdown table as follows: | SCORE2 Applicable | Exception (if not applicable) | SCORE2 (%) | Risk Category | Confidence Level 

3. Brief Clinical Explanation
Provide a brief clinical summary (maximum 150 words) highlighting the main factors that contributed to the assigned risk classification (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, smoking, elevated LDL, presence of risk modifiers, etc.).

4. Structured extraction of risk factors:

- Fill in a Markdown table with two fixed categories: “Risk Factors” and “Risk Modifiers”.
- For each variable, report the value as shown in the vignette or “unknown”; include units, where applicable.
- Maintain exactly the same variable names listed in the reference list below.
- If more than one option applies (e.g., multiple risk modifiers), list them separated by semicolons (;).

Reference list (do not alter names):
[Risk Factor -> Values; Age -> Numeric; Gender -> Male, Female; Smoking -> Non-smoker, Former Smoker, Smoker; Arterial Hypertension -> Yes, No; Systolic Blood Pressure -> Numeric; Diastolic Blood Pressure -> Numeric; Dyslipidemia -> Yes; No; Total Cholesterol -> Numeric; HDL-Cholesterol -> Numeric; Triglycerides -> Numeric; LDL-Cholesterol -> Numeric; non-HDL Cholesterol -> Numeric; Diabetes Mellitus -> Yes, No
Risk Modifiers -> Values; More than one can be selected -> Elevated Coronary Calcium Score; Calcium Score = 0; Carotid Plaques; Obesity; Pre-Diabetes; Family History of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); Elevated Lp(a); Increased Arterial Stiffness; Elevated High-sensitivity CRP; Chronic Inflammatory Disease; HIV Infection; Migraine with Aura; Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA); Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Erectile Dysfunction; Premature Menopause; Past history of Pregnancy Complications (Preeclampsia, Hypertension, or Diabetes); Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD); Cancer; Other (specify)]

6. General Formatting
- Use Markdown; do not include any text outside the sections above.
- If a value is not available, write “unknown”.
- Always use a comma (,) as a decimal separator and a dot (.) for thousands (Portuguese format).

7. Json File Creation
- In the end, create a json file that sumarizes the details with the following structure:
json_file ={
"Risk:{' SCORE2 Applicable': '..', ' Exception': '..',‘Category: '..', 'SCORE2': '..', ‘Confidence Level: ’..’ },"
"Risk Factors:{'Factor1':'value1','Factor2':'value2', …}
"Risk Modifiers: {FactorM1: 'ValueM1', FactorM2: 'valueM2', ...}}."
