A 65-year-old woman, bank employee, was referred from the diabetology clinic for cardiovascular risk management. She denies chest pain, syncope, or palpitations. She has gained weight and recently has been walking less—doing fewer than 5000 steps per day, mainly due to mechanical knee pain, although she also reports fatigue.

On physical examination, she weighed 84Kg (BMI 28.8); blood pressure was 138/75mmHg, and heart rate was 89bpm. No significant findings were noted.
Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin 13.2g/dL, creatinine 1.08mg/dL (eGFR 57mL/min/1.73 m2), fasting glucose 128mg/dL, HbA1c 6.9%, triglycerides 173mg/dL, total cholesterol 165mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 51mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 79mg/dL, NT proBNP 66pg/mL, and microalbuminuria 103mg/g.
Complementary diagnostic exams revealed an electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm at 81bpm with nonspecific ventricular repolarization changes. The echocardiogram showed concentric remodeling of the left ventricle, mild left atrial dilation, ejection fraction 59%, and E/e’ ratio of 9. The exercise test demonstrated low functional capacity, failing to reach 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate.
 
 
VINHETA26: 
A 36-year-old man, an IT professional, attended a follow-up consultation for cardiovascular risk optimization due to suspected familial hypercholesterolemia. He is asymptomatic. His lifestyle is predominantly sedentary. He does not smoke and drinks socially on weekends. He sleeps about six hours per day, with difficulty falling asleep early.
His family history includes a mother who had an acute myocardial infarction at age 47 (inferior infarction); a maternal aunt who died suddenly at age 51; and a maternal grandmother who died of heart failure at age 67.
On physical examination, he weighed 91Kg (BMI 27.7); blood pressure was 134/87mmHg, and heart rate was 76bpm. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation were unremarkable. No other findings were noted.
Laboratory tests showed creatinine 1.0mg/dL, fasting glucose 95mg/dL, triglycerides 164mg/dL, total cholesterol 336mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 45mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 258mg/dL. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation in the LDLR gene, consistent with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
He underwent electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, both without significant abnormalities. The exercise test was not suggestive of ischemia.
 
VINHETA27: 
A 61-year-old woman, nurse, presented with atypical chest pain described as a tightness lasting 5 to 10 minutes, without relation to exertion—mostly associated with periods of increased anxiety. She denies palpitations, syncope, or fatigue.
Her medical history includes smoking (10 pack-years) and anxiety.
Her current medications are sertraline 25mg and lorazepam 1mg.
On physical examination, she weighed 53Kg (BMI 20.1); blood pressure was 124/75mmHg, and heart rate was 69bpm. Cardiac auscultation revealed no abnormalities.
Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin 13.2g/dL, creatinine 0.58mg/dL, fasting glucose 78mg/dL, HbA1c 5.6%, triglycerides 87mg/dL, total cholesterol 199mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 54mg/dL, LDL cholesterol 87mg/dL, and NT-proBNP <75pg/mL.
Diagnostic tests included electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, both without significant abnormalities. Coronary CT angiography revealed a calcium score of 86 (50th–75th percentile), with occlusion of the mid right coronary artery and non-obstructive plaques (<50%) in the proximal circumflex and mid left anterior descending arteries.
 
VINHETA28: 
A 51-year-old man, chemical engineer at a plastics factory, attended a cardiovascular surveillance consultation for ischemic heart disease. He reports no chest pain or other cardiovascular symptoms.
